      "56   Chapter 3 Ziegleder and Oberparleiter (1996) have proposed a moisture treatment prior  to roasting. In this, steam is condensed on the nib, resulting in a water addition  of about 15%. This moisture aids the formation of more flavour precursors dur - ing the 10–15 min processing time at 40–60 °C (104–140 °F). After drying to 3% moisture at 98–110 °C (208–230 °F) and roasting, this gives a product with a  more intense flavour compared with normally roasted beans. Mohr et al. (1978) have demonstrated that a slow reduction in moisture con- tent to about 3% followed by a rapid heating to the final roast temperature is the  optimal way of roasting. The highest roasting temperature depends upon the required roast intensity and the equipment used. All types of roaster can be operated over a wide range of roasting conditions. Whole bean roasting was the original method and often used to produce  cocoa masses with delicate flavours, due to the preservation of the volatile cocoa flavour notes within the shell during roasting. Also the removal of the shell after this type of roasting is relatively easy, as the shell becomes loose dur - ing the roasting. Currently nib roasting is also widely used, in part due to dis-tinct improvements in cocoa powder obtained with alkalisation of the nib before roasting. Many different roasting systems are in the market place often using conduc- tion and/or convection as the heat transfer mechanism. Batch drum roasters are frequently used in the cocoa industry for nib roasting  (see Figure 3.5). The principle of these roasters is generally the same. Nib is fed into the drum and depending on taste requirements water can be added and a specific roasting profile will be applied. Roasting occurs by heat from the drum  wall and the product tumbles in the drum, thus avoiding burning and localised  overheating. Effective debacterisation can be carried out by adding water and assuring the  presence of steam in the drum. Roasting temperatures, holding times and amount of water added vary according to the equipment being used and the desired flavour profile of the product. Generally the final roasting temperature is 110–140 °C (230–284 °F). Microbiological tests must be carried out for each specific roasting profile to ensure that it kills all pathogens (e.g. Salmonella) and reduces the total bacterial content (Brenner, 1991; Cerny, 1991; see Chapter 25). After roasting, the product is cooled down in an external cooler. Using these  types of drum roasters it is extremely important to maintain a strict separation between the raw and roasted nibs, because the loading and discharge may occur through the same door and cross‐contamination of microbiological material can easily take place. Alternatively, continuous vertical air roasters can be used for cocoa beans or  nibs (see Figure 3.6). This type of shaft roaster is divided into a number of sec-tions; the top sections are used to roast, the lower ones for cooling. The roaster will be filled from the top and the product cascades down the  roaster through a series of shelves. Each shelf tilts to discharge its load onto the  one below, after a preset retention time. Hot air passes through special ventilation\n",

      "194   Chapter 8 of a shortened roasting time and of the partial removal of any excess acetic acid.  While acetic acid was only slightly reduced (from 6 to 5 g/kg) in the industrial  bean roasting (Jinap and Dimick, 1991), it was reduced from 6 to 3 g/kg during  cocoa mass roasting (Nuyken‐Hamelmann and Maier, 1987). Prior to roasting, cocoa may taste astringent, bitter, sour, flat, musty or  unclean. After roasting, cocoa possesses the typical intense aroma of cocoa and  shows a reduced acidity. Roasting at temperatures higher than about 150 °C (300  °F), or for too long a roasting time, results in “over‐roasted” cocoas, which have  a significant bitter and burnt, coffee‐like taste. Before roasting, pre‐drying is nec - essary to reduce water content below 4%, and during roasting the moisture level  decreases to about 2%. In industrial roasters, this pre‐drying takes place as a  separate processing stage. If roasted without pre‐drying, cocoa would generate a  cooked, flat aroma. As the formation of most flavour compounds is based on con - densation or decomposition reactions, a surplus of moisture would hinder these  reactions and furthermore evaporate volatile reaction products by steam distilla - tion. For example, pyrazines may develop at low moisture levels only (Hartman  et al., 1984). The temperature/time to which the cotyledons are roasted has an  effect on the flavour balance of the final chocolate. As the roasting is increased,  not surprisingly, the degree of roast flavour increases, but other factors are also  affected. As shown in Figure 8.7, the cocoa flavour intensity increases but the  acidity decreases (Lemmen, 2004; Beckett, 2006). While  specific cocoa volatiles,  such as phenylic or furylic compounds, are already developed at low roasting  temperatures, other volatiles, like pyrazines, need a higher roasting intensity. 8.4.2  Utilisation of flavour precursors The flavour precursors interact in the roasting process to produce the desired cocoa  flavour. Although the exact percentage of conversion depends upon the roasting  parameters, there is a characteristic average for the utilisation of the precursors:  0246810 Low roast Medium roast High roastCocoa  Roast  Acidity Figure 8.7  The effect of roasting conditions upon the taste of the final chocolate (Beckett and  Lemmen, 2004).

In a cocoa bean processing facility, modern technology today transports the  cocoa beans to the selected roasters to begin the process. There are several types  of roasting processes; the two most common methods of roasting are “whole  bean” roasting or “nib” roasting (see Chapter 3). 23.5.1  Whole bean roasting Whole bean roasting takes place typically on a fluidised bed or chamber at a  specific temperature and dwell time. The bean flow rate, depth of beans  being roasted and internal bean temperature are critical variables to optimise.  De‐bacterialisation through condensation is a method to pretreat whole beans  prior to roasting to improve the reduction of bacteria and prepare the cocoa  bean for shell removal (Figure  23.4). The moisture content is reduced from  about 7% to slightly less than 2%. As the moisture is driven off, the tempera - ture of the bean mass slowly rises. Flavour development is said to occur between  110 and 140  °C. Bean roasting allows for variety in the degree of roast and  development of flavour but, due to variability in bean size, it can be difficult to  Figure 23.4  Debacterialisation system in whole bean roasting.\n",

      "58   Chapter 3 dwell time regulate the degree of roast. In the JND directly heated continuous  dryer/roaster (see Figure 3.7), the process air is typically heated by in‐duct gas burn-ers before being channelled through a stationary head plate. As the drum rotates this air is only allowed into those channels that are below the beans or nibs. It then passes through louvres into the beans and partially fluidises them. This cross‐flow of  air relative to the movement of beans along the drum means that at any point along  the length of a section the gas temperature, humidity and flow rate are constant. Usually these types of roasters are divided in two or three sections. Each section can be separately heated and by adjusting the temperature, different flavours can be developed. After roasting the product is cooled in a continuous device. 3.7 Cocoa mass (cocoa liquor) 3.7.1 Grinding cocoa nibs Cocoa mass is produced by grinding cocoa nibs. Grinding is often a two‐stage process: a coarse grinding (see Figure 3.8) followed by a fine grinding stage. As was noted earlier, the fineness to which the mass needs to be ground depends upon its final use. An example of a ball mill used for fine grinding is shown in D FEBCC A Figure 3.6 Diagram of continuous bean/nib roasting system (Lehmann Maschinenfabrik  GmbH, Germany).

      "Recipes   495 from West Africa may be used, for example from the Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Ghana  and Cameroon (see Chapter 2). Substantial training has been given to many cocoa bean growers to improve  the quality and consistency of the crop, mainly in West Africa and South America, and has concentrated on organic, Fairtrade and, in particular, the qual- ity of regional and single estate crops. The blending of the cocoa beans/mass and  level of roasting is very important and is dependant upon several factors:1 Cocoa bean quality; 2 Producer experience in blending cocoa beans and roasting times and temperatures; 3 The equipment available and its use; 4 Purchasing practice. Cocoa mass is normally produced in one of two different ways. Whole bean  roasting involves blending, cleaning, roasting, breaking, winnowing, pre‐grind-ing and grinding. Alternatively, nib roasting is carried out by blending, drying (or  pre‐roasting), breaking, winnowing, roasting, pre‐grinding and grinding.  Chapter 3 describes these processes in more detail. The finer cocoa bean, such as the Criollo type is normally roasted at a lower  temperature range than the bulk Forastero type. For milk chocolate the lower roasting temperatures are normally preferred to give a good balance of milk and cocoa flavour. Roasted cocoa nibs and mass can also be modified by heat or steam treatment.The treatment modifies the roasted flavour by reducing undesirable acids as  well as providing some sterilisation of the cocoa mass and reducing conching times. Normally a blend of West Africa cocoa is used by European chocolate manu- facturers. The ratio will depend on the type of chocolate being produced, the cocoa availability, which varies from season to season and its cost. Currently there are many fine chocolates being made in smaller quantities  and using cocoa beans from specific “origins”: countries, specific regions or estates, variety or type of cocoa. These are normally dark chocolate with a high cocoa mass content to emphasise specific flavours. There is now quite a large number of artisan producers of these specialised chocolates aimed towards the highest quality and price market, normally using specialised ingredients, machin-ery, production and product knowledge (see Chapter 18). 20.3 Conching to develop flavours During conching (see Chapters 8 and 10), the flavour changes or modifications are affected by the following:1 Type and action of the conche; 2 Temperature of conching: (white 40–50 °C (104–122 °F); milk 40–70 °C  (104–158 °F); dark 50–90 °C (122–194 °F);\n",
