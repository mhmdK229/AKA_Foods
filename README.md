📖 Advanced RAG System for Book-Based Q&A
🤝 In Collaboration with AKA Foods

🌟 Project Overview
This project implements a cutting-edge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to answer questions from a specific book using advanced retrieval techniques. 🧠💡

🚀 Features & Techniques Used:
🔹 Fusion Retrieval – Combines multiple retrieval strategies for better relevance
📚 Hierarchical Indices – Structures embeddings for efficient search
🛠 Adaptive Retrieval – Dynamically adjusts retrieval strategies based on query complexity
⚡ RAPTOR – Optimized query processing for faster, more accurate responses

This work is based on Nir Diamant’s repository, extending and refining his approach to RAG for more powerful book-based Q&A. 🎯

⚙️ Technology Stack
🖥 LLMs: OpenAI GPT Models
📊 Vector Database: FAISS
🧬 Embeddings Model: OpenAI Embeddings
🛠 Frameworks & Libraries: LangChain, OpenAI API
🌐 Deployment: FastAPI (for API access), Streamlit (for UI)

🔥 Why This is Cool?
✅ Supercharged Retrieval – Context-aware, adaptive, and blazing fast! ⚡
✅ Scalable & Flexible – Handles multiple books, large documents, and complex queries 📚
✅ Cutting-Edge RAG – Implements the latest RAG advancements 🚀

🔮 Future Enhancements
🔸 Multi-document Support – Expanding beyond a single book
🔸 Fine-tuned Query Expansion – Improving retrieval accuracy for complex questions
🔸 Custom Fine-tuning of LLM – Adapting responses based on specific domain knowledge
